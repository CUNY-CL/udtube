The files in this folder are example yaml configs that can be used for three different subcommands UDTube inherits from the LightningCLI. 

These subcommands are 
- "fit"
- "test"
- "predict"

The minimal run for the software only requires changing the name of the parameters under the "model" and "data". 

To read more about the specific parameters for each subcommand you can use the terminal command:

```
$ python3 udtube.py <subcommand> --help
```

Alternatively, if a new yaml config is needed for any reason (for example, if you want to use the "validate" subcommand supported by LightningCLI)

```
$ python3 udtube.py <subcommand> --print_config                                                          
```
